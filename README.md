# my-Sass-portfolio
## Created by Brianna Armstrong in response to a Sass tutorial on Youtube.

#### This portfolio is a project created by me following along with a youtube tutorial. If you are interested in seeing the video I referenced, it is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs

#### I altered some items, used my own photos and plan to import projects into it until I get a portfolio put together from all of the skills I've learned. I adjusted the borders of some of the elements and the way they are placed when catering to larger screen size. This project is a mobile-first design. I hope to use it as inspiration for a future portfolio. 

#### I really enjoyed learning Sass -> scss as it shed a lot of light into the capabilities and I feel like I am in a position to better grasp those capabilities than I was a few years back.
